## Setup

Admin first creates their account at `/setup`. Staff accounts are created by the admin via User Management.

## Database Schema

### Core tables
- `users` — Staff/admin user accounts with section-level permissions
- `containers` — Container records (customer, BL#, vessel, status, clearing charges, etc.)
- `shipping_charges` — Section 1 charges per container
- `customs_charges` — Section 2 charges per container (includes duty tracking)
- `terminal_charges` — Section 3 charges per container
- `delivery_charges` — Section 4 charges per container
- `operations_charges` — Section 5 charges per container
- `section_approvals` — Per-section approval states (pending/approved/rejected)
- `audit_log` — Full change history with field-level diffs

### Phase 3 tables
- `container_timeline` — Event log per container (12 event types, status colors)
- `container_tasks` — Task management per container (priority, due dates, assignee)
- `container_documents` — Document attachments (multer uploads, section categorization)
- `custom_sections` — Admin-defined custom sections with color coding
- `custom_fields` — Custom fields within sections (text, number, date, dropdown, etc.)
- `custom_field_values` — Per-container values for custom fields

### Invoice tables (Task #12)
- `invoices` — Invoice records; `containerId` is nullable (null for multi-container invoices)
- `invoice_items` — One row per container per invoice (containerId, description, amount, sortOrder)
- `invoice_payments` — Payment records per invoice

## Phase Status

### Phase 1 ✅ COMPLETE
- Login system with JWT cookies
- Admin + staff user management
- Container records (upload from CSV/Excel, manual create)
- Container detail page with 5 charge sections (Shipping, Customs, Terminal, Delivery, Operations)
- Auto-calculation of Total Cost, Clearing Charges, Gross Profit
- Record locking (admin only)
- Audit trail per container
- Executive dashboard with charts
- Smart container table with search, filter, pagination

### Phase 2 ✅ COMPLETE
- Granular section-level permission system (view/edit per section per user)
- 10-stage workflow engine with progress bar and checklist
- Section submit → approval workflow
- Approval queue page (admin reviews/approves/rejects each section)
- My Tasks page (staff sees their pending sections)
- Role-aware dashboard (admin sees pending approvals; staff sees their open tasks)
- Enhanced audit trail with field-level before/after diffs

### Phase 3 ✅ COMPLETE
All 8 remaining features implemented:

1. **Operations Timeline** — Per-container event log with 12 event types and color-coded statuses. Add/delete events with timestamp and notes.

2. **Task Manager** — Per-container tasks with priorities (low/medium/high/urgent), due dates, staff assignment, status tracking, and overdue detection.

3. **Document Attachments** — File upload (PDF/images/Excel/Word up to 20MB), categorized by section, download/delete, multer-backed storage.

4. **Printable Container Summary** — `/containers/:id/print` opens a clean print-ready HTML page with full cost breakdown, approval status, profit/loss highlight, and a "Print/Save PDF" button.

5. **Profit Intelligence Alerts** — Dashboard panel using `/api/intelligence/alerts` — detects loss-making containers, low margins, outstanding duty, delayed operations, stale approvals, and overdue tasks.

6. **Enhanced Search & Filters** — Container list now has expandable filter panel: Profit Status (profitable/low margin/loss), Created From/To date range, animated show/hide with clear-all.

7. **Reports with Type Tabs** — Reports page now has 5 tabs: All Containers, Profitable, Loss-Making, Outstanding Duty, Completed — filters the displayed results and export count.

8. **Section Builder** — Admin-only inline tab ("Edit Sections") embedded in container detail page for creating custom sections with color coding, custom fields, and role visibility.

### Phase 4 ✅ COMPLETE

1. **Clients Feature** — Full CRUD for client accounts; DB table + nullable `clientId` FK on containers; API routes at `/api/clients`; Clients list page + Client detail page showing linked containers and financial stats.

2. **Enhanced Reports Page** — 5 report tabs: All Containers (with profitable/loss/duty/completed sub-tabs), Client Report (grouped by customer), Operations (by vessel & size), Financial (cost breakdown by category), Monthly Summary. Exports: CSV, Excel (4-sheet xlsx), PDF (browser print).

3. **Container-to-Client Linking** — Container detail page hero card shows linked client (clickable link to client page). Admin can link/unlink any container to a client via a dropdown dialog. API: `PATCH /api/clients/:id/link-container` and `PATCH /api/containers/:id/unlink-client`.

4. **API Server Fix** — Removed zod import from clients route (not available in api-server package); replaced with manual field validation. `formatContainer` now returns `clientId` and `clientName`.

### Phase 5 ✅ COMPLETE

1. **Invoice & Payment Tracking** — Full invoice lifecycle management. Create invoices from any container (auto-generates invoice number INV-YYYYMM-NNN, pulls from container total cost), optional VAT rate, due date, notes. Status flow: draft → sent → paid / partial / overdue. Record payments with method (bank transfer/cash/cheque/POS), reference/teller number, and date. Payment progress bar. Outstanding balance auto-calculated. Admin can delete payments (status recalculates). New `/invoices` list page in sidebar with outstanding/collected stats.

2. **WhatsApp Click-to-Send** — "Send via WhatsApp" button on invoice detail page. If the client linked to the container has a phone number stored, the button generates a `wa.me` link with a pre-written professional message (invoice number, container number, B/L, total, outstanding balance, due date). Opens WhatsApp with the message pre-filled — staff just hits Send. Free, no API required, works on desktop and mobile.

### New DB Tables (Phase 5)
- `invoices` — Invoice records (invoiceNumber, containerId, clientId, status, subtotal, vatAmount, total, dueDate, notes)
- `invoice_payments` — Payment records per invoice (amount, paidAt, paymentMethod, reference, notes)

### Phase 5 ✅ COMPLETE

1. **Notifications System** — Persistent read/unread alert tracking (`notifications_read` table). `/notifications` page with filters (all/unread/read, by type). Sidebar shows unread badge. Alerts auto-merge with read state per user. Mark-all-read + auto-mark-viewed on page visit.

2. **Clients Bulk Upload** — Clients page has DropdownMenu: "Add New Client" / "Bulk Upload (Excel)" / "Download Template". Bulk route: `POST /api/clients/bulk`. Hook: `useCreateClientsBulk`.

3. **Upload Mode Selector** — Upload page has two modes: General Upload (customer name from file) and Customer-Linked Upload (all rows linked to one selected client). `clientId` passed to `/api/containers/upload`.

4. **Container Aging Alerts** — Configurable thresholds in Settings (30/60/90-day aging + 7-day inactivity). `AgingBadge` on container list. 4 alert types: `aging_warn`, `aging_high`, `aging_critical`, `inactive`.

5. **Settings Page** — `/settings` (admin-only). Configures aging thresholds + email alert recipients. `Send Digest Now` button.

6. **Email Digest (Resend)** — `POST /api/notifications/send-email-digest` endpoint built. Reads `RESEND_API_KEY` env var. Sends HTML digest of critical/warning alerts. **NOTE: Resend integration was dismissed by user**. To enable: either connect via Replit Resend integration OR set `RESEND_API_KEY` as a secret manually.

Provider: Resend (`connector:ccfg_resend_01K69QKYK789WN202XSE3QS17V`)
Status: **NOT connected** — user dismissed the integration prompt.
To activate: connect the Resend integration or set `RESEND_API_KEY` secret.
From address used: `alerts@updates.costanalysis.app` (requires verified sender domain in Resend).

### Phase 6 ✅ COMPLETE

1. **Invoice Subtotal Fix** — Invoice creation now uses `clearingCharges` (what customer owes) not `totalCost` (internal business cost). Both the API (`POST /api/invoices`) and the dialog UI were corrected.

2. **Dashboard AR KPIs** — 3 new stat cards: Total Invoiced, Total Collected, Outstanding Receivables. Dashboard now shows 9 cards total.

3. **Dashboard Collections Trend Chart** — Monthly line chart (last 6 months) showing Invoiced vs. Collected amounts using Recharts `LineChart`.

4. **N+1 Fix** — Dashboard stats no longer re-queries the DB per vessel. Reuses the already-fetched charge maps (sMap, cMap, etc.) for the cost-by-vessel calculation.

5. **Container Detail Collections** — After Gross Profit, shows a "Collections" mini-table: Invoiced / Collected / Outstanding (from existing container invoices). Only shown if at least one invoice exists.

6. **Client Receivables API** — `GET /api/clients/:id/receivables` returns `totalInvoiced`, `totalCollected`, `totalOutstanding`, and a full `invoices[]` array with per-invoice payments. `GET /api/clients` list now includes `totalOutstanding` per client.

7. **Client Detail Receivables Panel** — If a client has invoices, shows Accounts Receivable card with Invoiced/Collected/Outstanding summary, expandable invoice table per-invoice.

8. **Client List Outstanding Badge** — Client cards show an amber "₦X.X owed" badge when they have outstanding balances.

### Receivables API
- `GET /api/clients` — Now includes `totalOutstanding` per client
- `GET /api/clients/:id/receivables` — Full AR summary + invoices with payments for a specific client

### Phase 7 ✅ COMPLETE

1. **Add Container Manual Form** — "Add Container" button in the containers list header (admin-only). Opens a dialog with all container fields: Customer Name*, Container #*, B/L Number*, Declaration, Size (20FT/40FT/40HC/45HC), Vessel, Clearing Charges (₦), and optional Client link. On success, navigates to the new container detail page. Empty state also shows an "Add your first container" CTA. Backend `POST /containers` now accepts `clientId` to link a client at creation time.

2. **Remove non-Maersk tracking links** — Removed the "Track on X" external link button from the container detail page header for non-Maersk containers. Container number in the `<h1>` is now always plain text. Maersk "Track Live" button (in-app API tracking) is preserved unchanged. Shipping line badge in the container list remains (informational only).

3. **Container basic-info editing** — "Edit Details" button (admin-only, hidden when container is locked) in the container detail page header. Opens a dialog pre-filled with Customer Name, Vessel, Size, Declaration, and Clearing Charges. Container # and BL # are shown read-only (immutable keys). On save, calls `PATCH /containers/:id` via `useUpdateContainer` and invalidates the container query to refresh the detail page.

### Phase 8 ✅ COMPLETE

1. **WhatsApp invoice messaging** — Two WhatsApp action buttons on the invoice detail page: "Send Invoice" (green) and "Send Reminder" (amber, only shown when outstanding balance > 0). Clicking either button calls the API, which builds a formatted Nigerian-business message, logs it to the `whatsapp_messages` DB table, and returns a wa.me URL. The browser then opens WhatsApp with the message pre-filled. Buttons are disabled (with tooltip) when the client has no phone number on file. Nigerian phone numbers (08XXXXXXXXX) are automatically normalized to E.164 (+234XXXXXXXXX) in the backend. A collapsible "WhatsApp Messages" section at the bottom of the invoice detail page shows the full log of all messages prepared/sent for that invoice, with type badge (Invoice/Reminder), phone, status, message preview, and timestamp. If Twilio credentials (TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID, TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN, TWILIO_WHATSAPP_FROM) are configured as secrets, messages are also sent directly via Twilio's WhatsApp Business API — without credentials the feature still works fully via wa.me links.

### Task #12 ✅ COMPLETE — Multi-container invoice creation

- `invoices.container_id` is now nullable — single-container invoices still set it; multi-container invoices leave it null
- New `invoice_items` table: one row per container per invoice (cascades on invoice delete)
- `POST /api/invoices` accepts `containerIds: number[]`; validates all containers share one client; inserts real DB rows with `.returning()` for accurate IDs
- GET routes return `items[]` on every invoice; WhatsApp builders list all container numbers from items
- `Container` type now includes `clientId` and `clientName` (fields already returned by the API)
- Frontend: new `CreateInvoiceDialog` (two-step: client selection → container checklist with running subtotal/VAT/total); invoice list shows multi-container indicator badge; invoice detail shows line-items table for multi-container invoices; container detail page pre-selects client + container

## Financial Calculations
All calculations in `artifacts/api-server/src/lib/calculations.ts`:
- `calcTotalCost(charges)` — Sum of all 5 sections
- `sumShipping/Customs/Terminal/Delivery/Operations(section)` — Per-section totals
- Gross Profit = Clearing Charges − Total Cost
- Invoice Subtotal = Clearing Charges (what customer owes to business)
